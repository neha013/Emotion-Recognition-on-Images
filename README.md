# Emotion-Recognition-on-Images
Classifies and edit facial expressions from a set of eight emotions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness and surprise. 

We have uploaded the model weights in a separate folder. If you wish to run the entire notebook without having the trouble of training the model, consider using the model weights.

Instructions on using the model weights:
----------------------------------------
The code has conditional statements to check the presence of model weights and skip training. To make use of it,
1. Download the model weights from the folder named "Model Weights"
2. Upload it in the "\content" folder in Google Colab. The model weights should be accessible by "\content\<model_weight>.h5"
